### Projects
**Cloud Security Assessment & Compliance**

I led a team that worked on cloud security assessment and compliance project to bolster our organization's security posture. We had concerns about the strength of our cloud defenses and wanted to ensure adherence to critical security regulations. To achieve this, we employed a multi-faceted approach that combined Agile methodologies with security best practice. This enhanced the organization's cloud security posture as well as reduced risk of data breaches and cyberattacks.


**Account & Dashboard**

My team handled a Salesforce Service Cloud project, implementing a system that transformed how we connect with customers. We built a central hub for all customer information in Accounts and empowered teams with actionable insights through custom Dashboards. This has led to faster response times, personalized service, and happier customers â€“ a win-win for everyone!.

This project focused on implementing a Tag Management system to enhance our customers experience during transactions. My team utilized tools like "*Google Tag Manager, Tealium*" to manage and deploy various tracking tags across our customers journey.
